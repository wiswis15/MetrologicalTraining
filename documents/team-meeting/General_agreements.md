# Team agreements

## Change management

* Preferably create a Jira ticket when implementing a feature, and use a reference of this ticket in repository commits 
and / or branches.

## Repository

* Preferably do feature development in a feature branch from the development branch (currently master), and merge back 
using a pull request. Refer to the Jira ticket in the name of the feature branch.
