# Agreements on code

## Coding style

* We use the [Wekbit coding style](https://webkit.org/code-style-guidelines/) as default. Make sure whenever you check 
in, to adhere to this coding style.

  Rationale: Readability increases when only one coding style is employed.
  
## Compiler features

* Do not use #pragma once, rather use a plain old #ifdef/#define/#endif guard.

  Rationale: see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/787533/is-pragma-once-a-safe-include-guard)
  
## C++11 coding

* Use the C++11 keyword **override** to signal the compiler that your are overriding a virtual method.
 
  Rationale: **override** protects you from thinking you override a method while you don't due to a different signature. 
  If you use **override**, the compiler will check whether there is a method with the exact same signature that you can 
  override (i.e. it is **virtual** and not **final**).
  
* Use the C++11 keyword **final** to signal a method should not be overridden.

  Rationale: **final** protects your method from being overridden. This is a new language construct in C++, and the 
  compiler will enforce it.
  
## Coding guidelines

* Don't be over-exposing, keep internal details internal

* Do not expose platform specific details

* Use asserts

  Rationale: Assert should be used to check for a condition that should never fail. If an asser triggers, this means 
  something is wrong. It is better to know something is wrong at the point where things could go wrong, that find out 
  as part of an obscure failure or crash.
