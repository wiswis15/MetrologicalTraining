# How to install Jekyll 3.x

Jekyll 3.x migth not be available as part of a default Linux distribution. Moreover, Jekyll 3.x requires a recent Ruby version, which is probably (also) missing.

The outlined steps enable both installs and are performed on an Ubuntu 15.10 live-system. 

## Install missing dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install git libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
```
## Prepare the environment

### Enable a custom Ruby enviroment

Download the Ruby environment manager 'rbenv'
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```
Update your search path
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Reload the Bash profile with the new settings
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Alternatively, replace the current shell
```
exec $SHELL
```
However, it is better to close the terminal and open a new one.
``` 
exit
```
Followed by 
```
ctrl+alt+t
```
This is the safer approach because it does not preserve the shell variables.
Initialise the Ruby environment
```
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Again, restart the terminal for the Bash settings to take effect.

### Enable custom Ruby builds to be installed

Download the 'rbenv-build' plugin
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```
Update your search path
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Once again, restart the terminal.

### Make new Ruby packes automatically available

To complete the enviroment, a sorf of Ruby package manager is required. This  package manager automatically configures the environment for new packages, a.k.a 'gems'. Therefore, install the 'rbenv-gem-rehash' plugin.

```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-gem-rehash.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-gem-rehash
```
## Install the required packages

### Install Ruby
Install Ruby version 2.2.3
```
rbenv install 2.2.3
```
Tell the system to use this version
```
rbenv global 2.2.3
```
Check the installed Ruby version
```
ruby -v
```
Add the 'Ruby' install location to the search path. Be aware that it is added at the end! Otherwise the enviroment has to be set to use the correct 'global' version for each new terminal (shell).
```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rbenv/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
One more time to restart the terminal with the updated Bash settings before Jekyll is installed in the user's home diretcory with

### Install the Ruby 'gems'

Add the 'gem' install location to the search path. In constrast to Ruby's version its subpath contains the value '2.2.0'.
```
export 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.2.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Install the Jekyll gem
```
gem install jekyll --user-install
```
Additional 'gems' can be installed in the same manner.
