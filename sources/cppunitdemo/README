CppUnit demo

===============

INTRODUCTION
_______________

The purpose of this basic demo application is to show how-to use the cppunit
framework for unit testing source code, in particular C++ sources. It further
serves as a demo application for Jenkins on how-to build, run and show cppunit
test application output within Jenkins in an auto-magical way.

INSTALL
_______________

Before compiling and running this demo app, the cppunit library needs to be
compiled and present. The cppunit library is used in LibreOffice and is now
being maintained at FreeDesktop, see [1] on the how-to. The cppunit library
is statically linked into the unit-test application.

TARGETS
_______________

all (default)        : creates the .depend file, after which it compiles both
                       the regular application as well as the unit-test one
run                  : builds and runs the regular application
runtest              : builds and runs the unit-test application, copies the
                       'testreport.xsl' file to current folder and fires up
                       firefox to display the unit-test end results
[out/]calculator     : builds the regular application
[out/]calculatortest : builds the unit-test application
clean                : removes all generated object files from the bin folder
clobber              : removes the bin folder including its contents
distclean            : resets project tree to virgin/clean checkout state by
                       removing all make generated output
depend               : auto-creates a .depend file containing the dependency
                       on sources and header files for the incremental build
                       after changes in source and/or header files

EXTENDING
_______________

To extend the project by adding a class/file including an unit-test class,
rules.mk needs to be updated as well as the UnitTest.h header file. A good
practice would be when adding a new class/file to the project to have the
unit-test class/file called similar, but extended with 'Test'.  E.g.
  class Calc -> class CalcTest,
  Calc.h -> CalcTest.h.
